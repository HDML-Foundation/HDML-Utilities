# @hdml/types

This module is part of the **HDML-Utilities** monorepo and provides type definitions for working with **HDML** (HyperData Markup Language). It includes a comprehensive set of TypeScript interfaces and type definitions that are essential for representing the structure and data of HDML documents, models, and their associated components.

## Overview

**@hdml/types** defines the core types required to interact with and manipulate HDML documents and data structures within the HDML ecosystem. These types act as the foundation for various operations, including parsing, serialization, and transformation of HDML content.

## Dependencies

This module depends on the `@hdml/schemas` package, which distributes FlatBuffers schema-based classes for serialization.

## Installation

To install this module, simply add it to your project:

```bash
npm install @hdml/types
```
